# Econometric Theory

This repository contains the code and data for the Econometric Theory course I taught at LMU Munich during the summer semesters of 2023, 2024, and 2025. The course covers a range of topics in econometric theory, and this repository is mainly dedicated to R code to illustrate the concepts discussed in the course.
# Tutorials

This repository includes several tutorials that provide practical examples and exercises related to the course material. The tutorials are designed to help students apply theoretical concepts in a hands-on manner using R.
# Code
The code in this repository is organized into scripts and R Markdown files. The scripts contain functions and data generation processes, while the R Markdown files provide detailed explanations and examples of how to use the code in the context of econometric theory.
